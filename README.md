## Getting started
This project uses **Gulp** to compile assets. To prepare the project for production, run:
```
npm run build
```

*Or* to start development and watch files for changes
```
npm run dev
```

**Do not** edit files in `/dist/` because they are automatically generated, and will be overwritten.
